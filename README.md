spring-ex16-crud
======================

This example builds on spring-ex15-crud, where we added CRUD functionality to our User table. In this example, we add CRUD functionality to our Roles table.  This example uses Spring 4.0.2 and Spring Security 3.2.3, and uses java configuration files rather than XML.

This example has been validated with the following environment on MS Windows 7:

1. Eclipse Kepler
   1.1 Spring Tool Suite (STS) 3.4.0.RELEASE - for Kepler
2. Java SDK 1.7.0_51 (separate install)
3. Tomcat 7.0.50 (separate install)
4. Maven 3.0.5 (separate install)
5. MySQL 5.5.29
